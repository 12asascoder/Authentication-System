Authentication System
This is a simple session-based authentication system built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions securely. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, and the system includes features like CSRF protection, rate limiting, and flash messages for user feedback.

Features
User Registration: Users can sign up with a username and password.

User Login: Users can log in with their credentials.

Session Management: User sessions are managed using express-session and stored in MongoDB.

Password Hashing: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.

CSRF Protection: All forms are protected against CSRF attacks.

Rate Limiting: Login and signup routes are rate-limited to prevent brute-force attacks.

Flash Messages: Provides user feedback for success and error messages.

Environment Variables: Configuration is managed using a .env file.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express: Web framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data.

Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.

bcrypt: Password hashing library.

express-session: Session management middleware.

connect-mongo: MongoDB session store for express-session.

csurf: CSRF protection middleware.

express-validator: Input validation middleware.

connect-flash: Flash messages for user feedback.

helmet: Security middleware for setting HTTP headers.

dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.

cookie-parser: Parses cookies for session management.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher): Download Node.js

MongoDB: Download MongoDB

Git (optional): Download Git

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
If you have Git installed, clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/authentication-system.git
cd authentication-system
If you don’t have Git, download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
This will install all the packages listed in package.json.

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

env
Copy
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth_demo
SESSION_SECRET=your_strong_secret_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
Replace your_strong_secret_key_here with a strong secret key for session encryption.

Replace mongodb://localhost:27017/auth_demo with your MongoDB connection string if it’s different.

4. Start MongoDB
Ensure MongoDB is running on your system. Open a new terminal and run:

bash
Copy
mongod
If MongoDB is installed correctly, it will start and listen on port 27017.

5. Run the Application
Start the server:

bash
Copy
node app.js
You should see the following output:

Copy
MongoDB connected
Server running on port 3000
6. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:

Home Page: http://localhost:3000

Signup Page: http://localhost:3000/signup

Login Page: http://localhost:3000/login

Profile Page: http://localhost:3000/profile (requires login)
